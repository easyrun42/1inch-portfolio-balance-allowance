## Quick start

1. Setup the `.env` file. You can look at `.env.example` as a reference to what you need. First you need to get a project id from [WalletConnect](https://walletconnect.com/) and a ethereum mainnet RPC node. This way we can let users connect to any wallet they'd like and also have a fast RPC.
2. You use `pnpm` to install dependencies. Simply just run `pnpm install` and then `pnpm dev` to start the development on http://localhost:3000.
